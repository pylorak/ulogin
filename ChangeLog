# CHANGELOG #

* urban-1 (dev)
 - Added: Support for key-based (API) authentication on PDO backend
 - Added: ChangeLog
 - Changed: PDO config to support dynamic DB configuration (optionally)
 - Added: GetAllUsers function to return username/id list (used for GUIs)
 - Added: Magic method __call implementation on ulLogin. ulLogin methods have 
	  priority over ulLoginBackend.
 - Added: Block/Delete Key functions where needed (PDO)
 - Added: Lazy log cleaning (when we authenticate a user) instead of cron job.
 - Bug Fix: IsUserBlocked was not functioning. Changed UserBlockExpires PDO 
          backend to public and fixed IsUserBlocked to compaire with time
          

# TODO LIST? #
 - Get list of blocked IPs with datails
 - Maybe have auth failure reason in uLogin (ie:UserBlocked, contact admin...)
   This can also by an enum/const
